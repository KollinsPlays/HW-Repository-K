# HW Repository K
Creation of the proverbial Hello World program.

Following the GitHub Guide, the same useless repository others named hello world.

I never used Github for anything but submitting bug reports and feature requests and can do basic scripting, but can't code my way out of a wet paper bag.

This README was edited in Eclipse to be pushed to GitHub.

And then it was edited on GitHub to be pulled to Eclipse, but I made a typo, so I corrected it in Eclipse and commited it back.
